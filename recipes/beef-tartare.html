    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        To make the beef tartare, first clean the meat from any nerves and fatty parts, then cut it first into strips and then into half-cm cubes. <br>
        Transfer the meat to a bowl and season with salt, pepper, oil and Tabasco. <br>
        Add the Worcestershire sauce and mix. Now clean and chop the shallot. Also chop the desalted capers, gherkins and parsley.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        You are ready to plate: use a pastry cutter to give the meat the shape of a medallion, then complete the dish with the condiments, 
        forming quenelles with the help of 2 teaspoons.<br>
        Then add the shallot and gherkins. Continue with the parsley, capers and mustard.<br>
        Finally, with the tip of the teaspoon, create a hollow on the surface of the tartare 19 and gently slide a yolk into the center<br>
        Your beef tartare is ready to be served
