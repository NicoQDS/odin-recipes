    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.<br>
        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add the guanciale.<br>
        Cook the guanciale until well browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes.<br>
        Remove from the heat and drain the guanciale on paper towels.<br>
        In a bowl, beat the egg yolks, half the Pecorino Romano, and a little black pepper until smooth and creamy; set aside.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm to the bite (al dente). Save some of the pasta cooking water!<br>
        Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. After a few seconds, pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring constantly, then add the remaining pecorino cheese and 1/2 cup of the cooking water.<br>
        Continue stirring until the egg mixture and starchy water have resulted in a creamy sauce that coats the spaghetti, stir in the bacon.

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Complete the Dish and Serve<br>
        Serve the spaghetti carbonara hot with a little extra black pepper to taste!
